## 5. RQT: Running
*The window will be blank for the first time use of rqt. Then you need to `select Plugins` > `Services` > `Service caller` from the menu bar at the top.*

### 5.1. Trying some of the services provided by service caller

*Select the /spawn service where the /clear is seen and can also be used to select other services also and /spawn will help in creating another turtle in the turtlesim window by replacing the digit 0 with another digit and string name also needs to be written and the result can be seen in the response and the turtlesim window.*

*Give the new turtle new name, `'ritik'`*

Enter new coordinates for the turtle to spawn at, like `x = 2.0` and `y = 2.0`.

## 5.2. Trying the set_pen service
*Now let’s give turtle1 a unique pen using the /set_pen service:*

To have turtle1 draw with a red line, change the value of `r => 255`, and the value of `width => 5`.

*If you return to the terminal where turtle_teleop_key is running and press the arrow keys, you will see `turtle1`’s pen has changed.*
Now, using teleport_abosulte service as shown in the figure below.

## 6. RQT: rqt_console
*A GUI tool called rqt_console is used in ROS 2 to inspect log messages. With the following command, you can start rqt_console in a new terminal:*
```
ros2 run rqt_console rqt_console
```

*The console's first part is where the system log messages from your system will appear. In the center, you can exclude severity levels to filter out messages. The mails with your custom string are highlighted in the bottom portion.*
## 7. Close Turtlesim
*To stop the simulation, you can enter `Ctrl + C` in the turtlesim_node terminal, and `q` in the teleop terminal.*
