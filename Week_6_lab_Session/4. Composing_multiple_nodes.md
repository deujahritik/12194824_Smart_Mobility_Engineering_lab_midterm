# Composing multiple nodes in a single process
## 1. Discover available components
*To see what components are registered and available in the workspace:*

```
ros2 component types
```
*The terminal will return the list of all available components:*


```
(... components of other packages here)
composition
  composition::Talker
  composition::Listener
  composition::Server
  composition::Client
```
## 2. Run-time composition using ROS services with a publisher and subscriber

*In the first shell, start the component container:*

```
ros2 run rclcpp_components component_container
```
*Open the second shell and verify that the container is running via ros2 command line tools:*


```
ros2 component list
```
*You should see a name of the component:*

```
/ComponentManager
```


*In the second shell load the talker component (see talker source code):*

```
ros2 component load /ComponentManager composition composition::Talker
```
*The command will return the unique ID of the loaded component as well as the node name:*

```
Loaded component 1 into '/ComponentManager' container node as '/talker'
```
*Now the first shell should show a message that the component was loaded as well as repeated message for publishing a message.*

#### Run another command in the second shell to load the listener component (see listener source code):
```
ros2 component load /ComponentManager composition composition::Listener
```
*Terminal will return:*

```
Loaded component 2 into '/ComponentManager' container node as '/listener'
```
*The ros2 command line utility can now be used to inspect the state of the container:*

```
ros2 component list
```
*You will see the following result:*

```
/ComponentManager
   1  /talker
   2  /listener
```
*Now the first shell should show repeated output for each received message*

# Run-time composition using ROS services with a server and client
*In the first shell:*

```
ros2 run rclcpp_components component_container
```
*In the second shell (see server and client source code):*

```
ros2 component load /ComponentManager composition composition::Server
ros2 component load /ComponentManager composition composition::Client
```
*In this case the client sends a request to the server, the server processes the request and replies with a response, and the client prints the received response.*

## 1. Run-time composition using dlopen
*This demo presents an alternative to run-time composition by creating a generic container process and explicitly passing the libraries to load without using ROS interfaces. The process will open each library and create one instance of each “rclcpp::Node” class in the library source code*

```
ros2 run composition dlopen_composition `ros2 pkg prefix composition`/lib/libtalker_component.so `ros2 pkg prefix composition`/lib/liblistener_component.so
```
## 2. Composition using launch actions
*While the command line tools are useful for debugging and diagnosing component configurations, it is frequently more convenient to start a set of components at the same time. To automate this action, we can use the functionality in ros2 launch.*

```
ros2 launch composition composition_demo.launch.py
```

# Advanced Topics
*Now basic operation of components have been done, we can take a look for more advanced topics.*

## 1. Unloading components
*In the first shell, start the component container:*
```
ros2 run rclcpp_components component_container
```
*Verify that the container is running via ros2 command line tools:*

```
ros2 component list
```
*You should see a name of the component:*

```
/ComponentManager
```
*In the second shell (see talker source code). The command will return the unique ID of the loaded component as well as the node name.*

```
ros2 component load /ComponentManager composition composition::Talker
ros2 component load /ComponentManager composition composition::Listener
```
*Use the unique ID to unload the node from the component container.*

```
ros2 component unload /ComponentManager 1 2
```
*The terminal should return:*

```
Unloaded component 1 from '/ComponentManager' container
Unloaded component 2 from '/ComponentManager' container
```
*In the first shell, verify that the repeated messages from talker and listener have stopped.*

## 1. Remapping container name and namespace
*The component manager name and namespace can be remapped via standard command line arguments:*
```
ros2 run rclcpp_components component_container --ros-args -r __node:=MyContainer -r __ns:=/ns
```
*In a second shell, components can be loaded by using the updated container name:*
```
ros2 component load /ns/MyContainer composition composition::Listener
```
## 2. Remap component names and namespaces

*Component names and namespaces may be adjusted via arguments to the load command.*

*In the first shell, start the component container:*
```
ros2 run rclcpp_components component_container
```
*Some examples of how to remap names and namespaces.*

*Remap node name:*
```
ros2 component load /ComponentManager composition composition::Talker --node-name talker2
```
*Remap namespace:*

```
ros2 component load /ComponentManager composition composition::Talker --node-namespace /ns
```
*Remap both:*

```
ros2 component load /ComponentManager composition composition::Talker --node-name talker3 --node-namespace /ns2
```
*Now use `ros2` command line utility:*

```
ros2 component list
```
*In the console you should see corresponding entries:*

```
/ComponentManager
   1  /talker2
   2  /ns/talker
   3  /ns2/talker
```
# Passing parameter values into components
*The ros2 component load command-line supports passing arbitrary parameters to the node as it is constructed. This functionality can be used as follows:*

```
ros2 component load /ComponentManager image_tools image_tools::Cam2Image -p burger_mode:=true
```
# Passing additional arguments into components
*The ros2 component load command-line supports passing particular options to the component manager for use when constructing the node. As of now, the only command-line option that is supported is to instantiate a node using intra-process communication. This functionality can be used as follows:*

```
ros2 component load /ComponentManager composition composition::Talker -e use_intra_process_comms:=true
```
