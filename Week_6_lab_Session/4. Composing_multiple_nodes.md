# Composing multiple nodes in a single process
## 1. Discover available components
To see what components are registered and available in the workspace:
```
ros2 component types
```
The terminal will return the list of all available components:

```
(... components of other packages here)
composition
  composition::Talker
  composition::Listener
  composition::Server
  composition::Client
```
## 2. Run-time composition using ROS services with a publisher and subscriber

In the first shell, start the component container:

```
ros2 run rclcpp_components component_container
```
Open the second shell and verify that the container is running via ros2 command line tools:


```
ros2 component list
```
You should see a name of the component:

```
/ComponentManager
```
In the second shell load the talker component (see talker source code):

```
ros2 component load /ComponentManager composition composition::Talker
```
The command will return the unique ID of the loaded component as well as the node name:

```
Loaded component 1 into '/ComponentManager' container node as '/talker'
```
Now the first shell should show a message that the component was loaded as well as repeated message for publishing a message.

#### Run another command in the second shell to load the listener component (see listener source code):
```
ros2 component load /ComponentManager composition composition::Listener
```
Terminal will return:

```
Loaded component 2 into '/ComponentManager' container node as '/listener'
```
The ros2 command line utility can now be used to inspect the state of the container:

```
ros2 component list
```
You will see the following result:

```
/ComponentManager
   1  /talker
   2  /listener
```
Now the first shell should show repeated output for each received message
# Run-time composition using ROS services with a server and client
In the first shell:

```
ros2 run rclcpp_components component_container
```
In the second shell (see server and client source code):

```
ros2 component load /ComponentManager composition composition::Server
ros2 component load /ComponentManager composition composition::Client
```
In this case the client sends a request to the server, the server processes the request and replies with a response, and the client prints the received response.

## 1. Run-time composition using dlopen
This demo presents an alternative to run-time composition by creating a generic container process and explicitly passing the libraries to load without using ROS interfaces. The process will open each library and create one instance of each “rclcpp::Node” class in the library source code

```
ros2 run composition dlopen_composition `ros2 pkg prefix composition`/lib/libtalker_component.so `ros2 pkg prefix composition`/lib/liblistener_component.so
```
## 2. Composition using launch actions
While the command line tools are useful for debugging and diagnosing component configurations, it is frequently more convenient to start a set of components at the same time. To automate this action, we can use the functionality in ros2 launch.

```
ros2 launch composition composition_demo.launch.py
```
