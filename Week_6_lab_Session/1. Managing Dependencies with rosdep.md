# Managing Dependencies with rosdep
## What is rosdep?
*`rosdep` is ROSâ€™s dependency management utility that can work with ROS packages and external libraries. rosdep is a command-line utility for identifying and installing dependencies to build or install a package.*

## How does rosdep work?
*`rosdep` will check for package.xml files in its path or for a specific package and find the rosdep keys stored within. Once the packages are found, they are installed and ready to go!*

## How do I use the rosdep tool?
*We are prepared to use the utility now that we have a basic understanding of rosdep, package.xml, and rosdistro. First, if using rosdep for the first time, it must be initialized using:*

```
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

*We can finally use rosdep install to install dependencies. This is often called once across a workspace that contains numerous packages in order to install all dependencies. If the workspace's root contained the source-code-containing directory src, a call for that might look like the following.*


```
rosdep install --from-paths src -y --ignore-src
```
