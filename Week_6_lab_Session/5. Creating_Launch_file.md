# Creating a launch file
## Prerequisites
*1.This tutorial uses the rqt_graph and turtlesim packages.*

*2. we will also need to use a text editor of your preference.*

*3. As always, we wont forget to source ROS 2 in every new terminal that we open.*

# Tasks
## 1. Setup
*lets Create a new directory to store our launch files:*
```
mkdir launch
```

## 2. Write the launch file
*Let’s put together a ROS 2 launch file using the `turtlesim` package and its executables. As mentioned above, this can either be in Python, XML, or YAML.*

*Lets Copy and paste the complete code into the `launch/turtlesim_mimic_launch.py` file:* 

```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node

def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription([
        Node(
            package='turtlesim',
            namespace='turtlesim1',
            executable='turtlesim_node',
            name='sim'
        ),
        Node(
            package='turtlesim',
            namespace='turtlesim2',
            executable='turtlesim_node',
            name='sim'
        ),
        Node(
            package='turtlesim',
            executable='mimic',
            name='mimic',
            remappings=[
                ('/input/pose', '/turtlesim1/turtle1/pose'),
                ('/output/cmd_vel', '/turtlesim2/turtle1/cmd_vel'),
            ]
        )
    ])
 ```

## 3. ros2 launch
*To run the launch file created above, enter into the directory you created earlier and run the following command:*

```
cd launch
ros2 launch turtlesim_mimic_launch.py
```

*Two turtlesim windows will open, and we will see the following `[INFO]` messages telling you which nodes your launch file has started:*
<img width="513" alt="Screenshot_41" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92029196/196044659-a0b1c686-bd52-40dd-8f81-160fd01793c1.png">


```
[INFO] [launch]: Default logging verbosity is set to INFO
[INFO] [turtlesim_node-1]: process started with pid [11714]
[INFO] [turtlesim_node-2]: process started with pid [11715]
[INFO] [mimic-3]: process started with pid [11716]
```
*To see the system in action, we open a new terminal and run the `ros2 topic pub` command on the `/turtlesim1/turtle1/cmd_vel` topic to get the first turtle moving*
```
ros2 topic pub -r 1 /turtlesim1/turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 2.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: -1.8}}"

```
*Now both the turtules are following the same path*

## 4. Introspect the system with rqt_graph
*While the system is still running, we open a new terminal and `run rqt_graph` to get a better idea of the relationship between the nodes in your launch file.*

*Let's Run the command*
```
rqt_graph
```
<img width="307" alt="Screenshot_44" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92029196/196044794-11137758-4837-43b1-86c5-049e8bc81321.png">

*A hidden node (the ros2 topic pub command you ran) is publishing data to the `/turtlesim1/turtle1/cmd_vel` topic on the left, which the `/turtlesim1/sim` node is subscribed to. The rest of the graph shows what was described earlier: mimic is subscribed to /turtlesim1/sim’s pose topic, and publishes to `/turtlesim2/sim’s` velocity command topic.*
