# Creating an action
## Prerequisites

*Colcon and ROS 2 must be installed.*

*Establish a workspace and a package called "action tutorials interfaces":*

*(Remember to source first from your ROS 2 installation.)*

```
mkdir -p ros2_ws/src #you can reuse existing workspace with this naming convention
cd ros2_ws/src
ros2 pkg create action_tutorials_interfaces
```

# Tasks
## 1. Defining an action
*Actions are described in .action files with the following format:*

```
# Request
---
# Result
---
# Feedback
```
*Create a directory called "action" in our ROS 2 package called "action tutorials interfaces":*

```
cd action_tutorials_interfaces
mkdir action
```

*Make a file called Fibonacci in the action directory. action that includes the following information:*

```
int32 order
---
int32[] sequence
---
int32[] partial_sequence
```
## 2. Building an action
*The definition of the new Fibonacci action type must be sent to the pipeline that generates Rosidl code before we can use it in our code.*

*The following lines need be added to our CMakeLists.txt before the ament package() line in the action tutorials interfaces to achieve this:*

```
find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)

rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
  "action/Fibonacci.action"
)
```

*We must also include the necessary dependencies in our package.xml file:*

```
<buildtool_depend>rosidl_default_generators</buildtool_depend>

<depend>action_msgs</depend>

<member_of_group>rosidl_interface_packages</member_of_group>
```
*The fact that action definitions contain additional metadata means that we must rely on action msgs (e.g. goal IDs).*

*The package containing the definition of the Fibonacci action should now be able to be built:*

```
# Change to the root of the workspace
cd ~/ros2_ws
# Build
colcon build
```

*We are done!*

*Action types will often start with the term "action" and the package name. As a result, our new action will be referred to by its complete name, action tutorials interfaces/action/Fibonacci.*

*Using the command line tool, we can verify that our action was built successfully:*

```
# Source our workspace
# On Windows: call install/setup.bat
. install/setup.bash
# Check that our action definition exists
ros2 interface show action_tutorials_interfaces/action/Fibonacci
```

*The definition of the Fibonacci action should appear on the screen.*
