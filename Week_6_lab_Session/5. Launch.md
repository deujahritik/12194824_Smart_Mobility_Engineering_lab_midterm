# Creating a launch file
## Prerequisites
*1.This tutorial uses the rqt_graph and turtlesim packages.*

*2. we will also need to use a text editor of your preference.*

*3. As always, we wont forget to source ROS 2 in every new terminal that we open.*

# Tasks
## 1. Setup
*lets Create a new directory to store our launch files:*
```
mkdir launch
```

## 2. Write the launch file
*Let’s put together a ROS 2 launch file using the `turtlesim` package and its executables. As mentioned above, this can either be in Python, XML, or YAML.*

*Lets Copy and paste the complete code into the `launch/turtlesim_mimic_launch.py` file:* 

```python
from launch import LaunchDescription
from launch_ros.actions import Node

def generate_launch_description():
    return LaunchDescription([
        Node(
            package='turtlesim',
            namespace='turtlesim1',
            executable='turtlesim_node',
            name='sim'
        ),
        Node(
            package='turtlesim',
            namespace='turtlesim2',
            executable='turtlesim_node',
            name='sim'
        ),
        Node(
            package='turtlesim',
            executable='mimic',
            name='mimic',
            remappings=[
                ('/input/pose', '/turtlesim1/turtle1/pose'),
                ('/output/cmd_vel', '/turtlesim2/turtle1/cmd_vel'),
            ]
        )
    ])
 ```

## 3. ros2 launch
*To run the launch file created above, enter into the directory you created earlier and run the following command:*

```
cd launch
ros2 launch turtlesim_mimic_launch.py
```
<img width="366" alt="Screenshot_40" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92029196/196044637-72e91818-02d0-43e1-949b-56c690171e85.png">

*Two turtlesim windows will open, and we will see the following `[INFO]` messages telling you which nodes your launch file has started:*
<img width="513" alt="Screenshot_41" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92029196/196044659-a0b1c686-bd52-40dd-8f81-160fd01793c1.png">


```
[INFO] [launch]: Default logging verbosity is set to INFO
[INFO] [turtlesim_node-1]: process started with pid [11714]
[INFO] [turtlesim_node-2]: process started with pid [11715]
[INFO] [mimic-3]: process started with pid [11716]
```
*To see the system in action, we open a new terminal and run the `ros2 topic pub` command on the `/turtlesim1/turtle1/cmd_vel` topic to get the first turtle moving*
```
ros2 topic pub -r 1 /turtlesim1/turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 2.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: -1.8}}"
<img width="367" alt="Screenshot_42" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92029196/196044704-578dbd70-2740-482d-9caf-ba92baebae8a.png">

```
*Now both the turtules are following the same path*
<img width="507" alt="Screenshot_43" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92029196/196044752-6a27d7fa-b3c0-4ebd-aac2-dee43ad0b655.png">


## 4. Introspect the system with rqt_graph
*While the system is still running, we open a new terminal and `run rqt_graph` to get a better idea of the relationship between the nodes in your launch file.*

*Let's Run the command*
```
rqt_graph
```
<img width="307" alt="Screenshot_44" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92029196/196044794-11137758-4837-43b1-86c5-049e8bc81321.png">

*A hidden node (the ros2 topic pub command you ran) is publishing data to the `/turtlesim1/turtle1/cmd_vel` topic on the left, which the `/turtlesim1/sim` node is subscribed to. The rest of the graph shows what was described earlier: mimic is subscribed to /turtlesim1/sim’s pose topic, and publishes to `/turtlesim2/sim’s` velocity command topic.*



# Integrating launch files into ROS 2 packages
## Prerequisites
*We should have gone through the tutorial on how to create a ROS 2 package.*

*As always, we don’t forget to source ROS 2 in every new terminal you open.*

# Tasks
## 1. Create a package
*Create a workspace for the package to live in:*
```
mkdir -p launch_ws/src
cd launch_ws/src
```
<img width="187" alt="Screenshot_45" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92029196/196044819-25cc0f9a-c0d0-4fed-8dd1-6cbecca88cf8.png">



*For Python Pakage*
```
ros2 pkg create py_launch_example --build-type ament_python
```
<img width="368" alt="Screenshot_46" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92029196/196044848-49d8f151-0a08-4b15-a0fc-98caf5291be8.png">


## 2 Creating the structure to hold launch files
*By convention, all launch files for a package are stored in the `launch` directory inside of the package.We Make sure to create a `launch` directory at the top-level of the package you created above.*

*For Python packages, the directory containing your package should look like this:*
```
src/
  py_launch_example/
    package.xml
    py_launch_example/
    resource/
    setup.py
    setup.cfg
    test/
```
*In order for colcon to find the launch files, we need to inform Python’s setup tools of our launch files using the `data_files` parameter of `setup`.*

*Inside our `setup.py` file*

```python
import os
from glob import glob
from setuptools import setup

package_name = 'py_launch_example'

setup(
    # Other parameters ...
    data_files=[
        # ... Other data files
        # Include all launch files.
        (os.path.join('share', package_name), glob('launch/*launch.[pxy][yma]*'))
    ]
)
```

## 3. Writing the launch file

*For Python launch file.*

*Inside our launch directory, create a new launch file called my_script_launch.py. _launch.py is recommended, but not required, as the file suffix for Python launch files.*

*Our launch file should define the `generate_launch_description()` function which returns a `launch.LaunchDescription()` to be used by the `ros2 launch` verb.*

```python
import launch
import launch_ros.actions

def generate_launch_description():
    return launch.LaunchDescription([
        launch_ros.actions.Node(
            package='demo_nodes_cpp',
            executable='talker',
            name='talker'),
  ])
``` 
<img width="378" alt="Screenshot_48" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92029196/196044934-c9916ed6-e4d8-4270-910f-65a7aafa0722.png">
 
*For XML launch fileYAML launch file.*

*Inside our launch directory, lets create a new launch file called `my_script_launch.xml`. `_launch.xml` is recommended, but not required, as the file suffix for XML launch files.*

```
<launch>
  <node pkg="demo_nodes_cpp" exec="talker" name="talker"/>
</launch>
```
## 4. Building and running the launch file
*Lets Go to the top-level of the workspace, and build it:*
```
colcon build
```

*After the `colcon build` has been successful and we’ve sourced the workspace, we should be able to run the launch file as follows:*

```
ros2 launch py_launch_example my_script_launch.py
```
