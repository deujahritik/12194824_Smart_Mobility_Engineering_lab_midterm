# Creating custom msg and srv files

# 1. creating package
*Run the package creation command by going to ros2 ws/src:*
```
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake tutorial_interfaces
```

# 2.Create custom definitions
## 2.1 MSG definition
*In the tutorial interfaces/msg directory that you just created, make a new file named Num.msg, and then add a single line of code describing the data structure in Num.msg:*
```
int64 num
```
*This custom message sends a single value, the 64-bit integer num.*

*In the directory you just created for the tutorial interfaces/msg, make a new file called Sphere.msg and put the following information in it:*
```
geometry_msgs/Point center
float64 radius
```
*A message from a different message package—in this case, geometry msgs/Point—is used in this custom message.*
## 2.2srv definition
*In the instructional interfaces/srv directory that you just created, add a new file with the name AddThreeInts.srv with the following request and response structure:*
```
int64 a
int64 b
int64 c
---
int64 sum
```
*This is a custom service that accepts three integers with names a, b, and c and returns an answer with the integer sum.*

# 3.CMakeLists.txt
*Add the following lines to CMakeLists.txt to translate the interfaces you defined into language-specific code (such C++ and Python) so they may be utilized in those languages:*
```
find_package(geometry_msgs REQUIRED)
find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)

rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
  "msg/Num.msg"
  "msg/Sphere.msg"
  "srv/AddThreeInts.srv"
  DEPENDENCIES geometry_msgs # Add packages that above messages depend on, in this case geometry_msgs for Sphere.msg
)
```
# 4.package.xml
*These lines should be added to package.xml.*
```
<depend>geometry_msgs</depend>

<build_depend>rosidl_default_generators</build_depend>

<exec_depend>rosidl_default_runtime</exec_depend>

<member_of_group>rosidl_interface_packages</member_of_group>
```

# 5.Build the tutorial_interfaces package
*You may construct your custom interfaces package now that all of its components are in place. Run the command below in the workspace's root (~/ros2_ws):*
```
colcon build --packages-select tutorial_interfaces
```

*Other ROS 2 programs will now be able to find the interfaces.*

# 6.Confirm msg and srv creation
*Run the following command from within your workspace (ros2 ws) to source it in a new terminal:*
```
. install/setup.bash
```
*should return:*
```
int64 num
```
*and:*
```
ros2 interface show tutorial_interfaces/msg/Sphere
```
*should return:*
```
geometry_msgs/Point center
        float64 x
        float64 y
        float64 z
float64 radius
```
*and:*
```
ros2 interface show tutorial_interfaces/srv/AddThreeInts
```
*should return:*
```
int64 a
int64 b
int64 c
---
int64 sum
```
