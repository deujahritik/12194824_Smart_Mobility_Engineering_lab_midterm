# Course goal
*• This course consists of multiple guided tutorials and lab sessions with increasing difficulty levels when working with an autonomous robot and machine learning.*

*• You learn how to set up such a TurtleBot3 from scratch using ROS/ROS2, how to interface the individual sensors and actuators, and finally, how to implement the practical projects. 

*• This course provides students with hands-on lab experience applying Ai and robot programming techniques for implementing the final autonomous robot projects.*
